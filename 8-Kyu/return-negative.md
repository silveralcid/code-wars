# Make a Number Negative

## Description
Create a function that takes a **number** and returns it as a **negative value**.  
If the number is already negative, it should remain unchanged.

---

## Examples
| Input | Output |
|--------|---------|
| `1` | `-1` |
| `-5` | `-5` |
| `0` | `0` |

---

## Notes
- If the number is already **negative**, return it unchanged.  
- **Zero (0)** should return `0` â€” negative zero is not considered meaningful.  
- The input will always be a **number**.
