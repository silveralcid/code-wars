# Family Age Difference

## Description
At the annual family gathering, the family likes to find the oldest living family member’s age, the youngest family member’s age, and calculate the difference between them.  
You are given an array containing the ages of all family members, in any order. Ages are represented as whole numbers — for example, a baby of 5 months will have an assigned age of `0`.  

Return a new array (or a tuple in Python) in the format `[youngest_age, oldest_age, age_difference]`.

## Example
ages = [82, 15, 6, 38, 2]  
Output → [2, 82, 80]

## Notes
- Input: list of integers representing ages  
- Output: list or tuple `[min_age, max_age, difference]`
