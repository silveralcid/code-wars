# Remove First and Last Character

## Task
Write a function that removes the **first** and **last** characters of a string.  
You're given one parameter: the **original string**.

### Important
Your function should handle strings of any length **â‰¥ 2 characters**.  
For strings with exactly **2 characters**, return an **empty string**.

---

## Examples
| Input | Output |
|--------|---------|
| `'eloquent'` | `'loquen'` |
| `'country'`  | `'ountr'` |
| `'person'`   | `'erso'` |
| `'ab'`       | `''` *(empty string)* |
| `'xyz'`      | `'y'` |

---

## Requirements
- The input string will always have **at least 2 characters**.
- For strings with exactly **2 characters**, return an **empty string**.
- For strings with **3 or more characters**, remove the **first and last character**.
- The function should handle strings containing **letters, numbers, and special characters**.

---

## Test Cases
Your solution will be tested against:
- Basic functionality with common words  
- Edge cases with 2-character and 3-character strings  
- Strings containing numbers and special characters  
- Random test cases of varying lengths
