## Task

Sum all the numbers of a given array (or list), **except the highest and lowest elements** (by value, not by index).

- The highest and lowest elements are treated as single instances, even if duplicates exist.
- Input validation is required.

---

### Example

```text
{ 6, 2, 1, 8, 10 } => 16
{ 1, 1, 11, 2, 3 } => 6
```
````

### Input Validation

If the input is:

- `null`, `None`, `Nothing`, `nil`, etc.
- an empty list `[]`, or
- a list with only one element

Return `0`.

---

### Fundamentals

Implement logic to:

1. Validate input.
2. Exclude the minimum and maximum values (only one occurrence each).
3. Sum the remaining numbers.
4. Return `0` if the input is invalid or too short.

```

```
