# Vacation Car Rental Calculation

After a hard quarter in the office, you decide to take a vacation to unwind. Youâ€™ll book flights for you and your girlfriend and rent a car to get around during your trip.

The car rental company provides the following pricing rules:

- Daily rate: **$40 per day**
- Discount conditions:
  - **$50 off** for rentals of **7 or more days**
  - **$20 off** for rentals of **3 or more days**

Write a function that calculates the total cost of the rental given the number of days (`d`).

1. Takes an integer `d` (number of days) as input.
