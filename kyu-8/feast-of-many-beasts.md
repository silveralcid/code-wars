### Instructions

**Task:**  
Write a function `feast` that determines whether an animal is allowed to bring a given dish to the feast.

**Rules:**
- The **dish** must start **and** end with the same letters as the **animal's name**.
- Both `beast` and `dish` are lowercase strings.
- Each has at least two letters.
- They may contain spaces or hyphens, but not at the beginning or end.

**Requirements:**
- Input: two strings â€” `beast` and `dish`.
- Output: `True` if the dish starts and ends with the same letters as the beast; otherwise `False`.

**Example:**
```python
feast("great blue heron", "garlic naan")      # True
feast("chickadee", "chocolate cake")          # True
feast("brown bear", "bear claw")              # False
````
