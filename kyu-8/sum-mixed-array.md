### Instructions

**Task:**  
Write a function `sum_mix` that takes an array containing integers represented as **strings** and **numbers**, and returns the **sum** of all elements as a number.

**Requirements:**
- Convert all string elements to numbers before summing.
- Return the total sum as a number (not a string).

**Example:**
```python
sum_mix([9, 3, '7', '3'])     # 22
sum_mix(['5', '0', 9, 3, 2, 1, '9', 6, 7])  # 42
sum_mix([10, 20, 30])         # 60
````

**Fundamentals:**
Strings, Arrays, Type Conversion, Summation

```
