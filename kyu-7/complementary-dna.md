### Task

In DNA strings, the symbols **"A"** and **"T"** are complements of each other, as are **"C"** and **"G"**.
Your function receives one side of the DNA (a string) and must return the other complementary side.

You can assume:

* The DNA strand is never empty.
* The input always consists of valid DNA characters (`A`, `T`, `C`, `G`).
